Every individual in this world is always interested in knowing his future. Astrology tries to predict the future of an individual to its best. These predictions are based on the positions of various planetary positions and the various heavenly bodies at the time of your birth. The accuracy in determining the planetary positions plays an important role in astrology. The planetary positions vary largely based on your birth location and the time of birth. Astrologers also need the positions of heavenly bodies in a given time in future. This repository provides the implementation of computing planetary positions and heavenly bodies at any location in the world at any given time. This library is open-source and written fully in Python.
